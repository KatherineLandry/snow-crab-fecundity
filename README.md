# Snow Crab Fecundity
Snow crab fecundity data and programs

## Sampling Protocol (1986-1988)

* From four geographic locations:
  - Baie-des-Chaleurs
  - Bradelle Bank
  - Prince Edward Island
  - Cape Breton
  
* Three different fishing gears were used:
  - 5-meter beam trawl
  - 20-meter Bigouden Nephrops trawl
  - Conventional snow crab traps (square?)
  
* Between April 1986 and June 1988, in the Baie-des-Chaleurs, Bradelle Bank and Prince Edward Island locations, 11 samples totaling 698 females were collected. The widths of each carapace and 5th segment of the abdomen were measured to the nearest millimeter. The position and number of missing legs, carapace rigidity (soft, medium and hard), degree of coverage of the carapace by epibionts (old, medium and new), and the colour of the eggs (orange, dark orange, brown and black) were recorded as possible indices of, respectively: ability to groom the eggs during incubation, time elapsed since the last moult, and time elapsed since spawning. Females with abnormally small clutch sizes, unfertilized eggs or hatching eggs were not used (Conan et al, 1989). 

* Primiparous females (i.e. first-time spawners) were identified by their softer, cleaner carapaces with few or no visible mating grasping marks. Multiparous females (i.e. multiple spawners) had harder, dirtier carapaces and bore multiple mating and grasping marks.

## Egg sample preparation and measurement (1986-1992)

* In the laboratory, abdomens bearing external eggs were removed and preserved in a 40% formalin solution. Pleopods with attached egg clutches were later separated using scissors and dried at 60C for 24 hours. The dried eggs were separated from pleopods and weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg. For each female, the average egg dry weight was calculated from a weighed and counted subsample of eggs, which was then used to calculate the fecundity, defined here as the total number of eggs per brood.

## Egg sample preparation and measurement in 1989 and 1990 (from Mallet et al. 1993)

* The females were collected in the Baie des Chaleurs (47 55'N, 64 35'W) at depths varying from 80 to 90 meters using a Bay of Biscay Bigouden *Nephrops* trawl hauled by a 18.5-meter research ship, the CCGS Opilio. From May 1989 to December 1990, 54 trawl hauls provided a set of samples totalling 629 females.

Cursory information was recorded for each female captured: state of fouling of the carapace (clean, presence of epibionts, full cover of epibionts), colour of the eggs (orange, brown=, black), colour of the gonad (being, light orange, bright orange), width of the carapace, reproduction instances: either primiparous or multiparous. Primiparous females were identified as clean carapace females bearing no grasping marks. The primiparous females have mated shortly after the moult to morphometric maturity, while still in the soft carapace state, they carry their first brood. Males hold tightly the pereiopods of females in their claws during the precopulatory embrace and conspicuous scars can be observed after mating, except if the carapace was still soft at the time of mating, i.e. primiparous.

A subsample was taken every month for detailed analysis. Five females were selected within each available 5mm size class and colourn of eggs. A gonad, and about a hundred eggs were taken from each female and preserved in Bouin's fluid for histology or direct light microscopy observation.

### Laboratory processing

Cursory observations based on the colour of the eggs or of the gonads can be made at sea on a large number of individuals. However, these simple indices may be unreliable and needed to be calibrated by comparison with a subsample studied in detail at the laboratory by histology and microscopic observations.

The ovaries were fixed in Bouin's fluid for 48 hours, and then preserved in 70% ethanol. Standard techniques were used for inclusion in paraffin wax. The tissues were sectioned at 7 micrometer thickness and stained by Masson's trichrome, using picrofuchsine as an intermediate stain. The preparations were observed by standard light microscopy at 60X to 400X magnifications and photographed. The stages of development of the ovocytes were identified according to the criteria described by Laulier (174), Johnson (1980) and Kon (1980).

The eggs were preserved in Bouin's fluid during 72 hours and observed *in toto* under a stereomicroscope at magnifications varying from 16X to 40X. The stages of development were defined as described by Kon (1980). A few drops of light green at 1% dilution were added to increase the contrast and improve observation of the appendages.
