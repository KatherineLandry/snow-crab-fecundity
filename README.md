 Snow crab fecundity data and programs

## 1986-1988 Sampling Protocol

* From four geographic locations
  - Baie-des-Chaleurs
  - Bradelle Bank
  - Prince Edward Island
  - Cape Breton
  
* Fishing gear used was 5-meter beam trawl, 20-meter Nephrops trawl and conventional snow crab traps (square?)
* Between April 1986 and June 1988, 11 samples totaling 698 females were collected. The widths of the carapace and of the 5th segment of the abdomen were measured to the nearest millimeter. The position and number of missing legs, carapace rigidity (soft, medium and hard), degree of coverage of the carapace by epibionts (old, medium and new), and the colour of the eggs (orange, dark orange, brown and black) were recorded as indices of, respectively: ability to groom the eggs during incubation, time elapsed since the last moult, and time elapsed since spawning.

The females with abnormally low clutch size, unfertilized eggs and hatching were not used. The spawning category (primiparous and multiparous) was identified by carapace cleanliness and presence/absence of male grasping marks on the legs. Females which spawn for the first time mate shortly after their terminal moult leading to maturity and are called primiparous, they usually bear no mating grasping marks. Females who mated and spawned several times after the terminal moult, while being in hard shell are said to be multiparous, and usually bear mating and grasping marks.

The abdomens bearing external eggs were preserved in 40% formalin solution, and the pleopods with attached egg massses were later removed using scissors and dried at 60C for 24 hrs. The dried eggs were separated from. pleopods and weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg. A subsample of eggs was also weighed, and its eggs were counted. The fecundity defined here as the number of eggs per brood, was caluclated by extrapolation.
