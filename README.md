# Snow Crab Fecundity
Snow crab fecundity data and programs

## Sampling Protocol (1986-1988)

* From four geographic locations:
  - Baie-des-Chaleurs
  - Bradelle Bank
  - Prince Edward Island
  - Cape Breton
  
* Three different fishing gears were used:
  - 5-meter beam trawl
  - 20-meter Bigouden Nephrops trawl
  - Conventional snow crab traps (square?)
  
* Between April 1986 and June 1988, in the Baie-des-Chaleurs, Bradelle Bank and Prince Edward Island locations, 11 samples totaling 698 females were collected. The widths of each carapace and 5th segment of the abdomen were measured to the nearest millimeter. The position and number of missing legs, carapace rigidity (soft, medium and hard), degree of coverage of the carapace by epibionts (old, medium and new), and the colour of the eggs (orange, dark orange, brown and black) were recorded as possible indices of, respectively: ability to groom the eggs during incubation, time elapsed since the last moult, and time elapsed since spawning. Females with abnormally small clutch sizes, unfertilized eggs or hatching eggs were not used. 

* Primiparous females (i.e. first-time spawners) were identified by their softer, cleaner carapaces with few or no visible mating grasping marks. Multiparous females (i.e. multiple spawners) had harder, dirtier carapaces and bore multiple mating and grasping marks.

## Egg sample preparation and measurement (1986-1992)

In the laboratory, abdomens bearing external eggs were removed and preserved in a 40% formalin solution. Pleopods with attached egg clutches were later separated using scissors and dried at 60C for 24 hours. The dried eggs were separated from pleopods and weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg. For each female, the average egg dry weight was calculated from a weighed and counted subsample of eggs, which was then used to calculate the fecundity, defined here as the total number of eggs per brood.
